# 10 Days Of Code

## 👩‍💻 What is 10 Days of Code?
_Is there a project you’ve been wanting to make?
Do you struggle to find time to learn how to code?_

10 Days of Code is a gift to Hack Clubbers to level up their coding skills!

This summer, Hack Club invited 10 Hack Clubbers to spend two weeks at Hack Club HQ in Shelburne, VT building projects without the expectations of school or work.

The goal is for Hack Clubbers to have a finished, shipped project by the end of the 10 Days of Code, while learning more about coding and the developmental process.
